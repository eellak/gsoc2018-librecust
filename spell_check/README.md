# Spell check for Librecust
Spell checking is a feature much needed while editing legal, and in general any kind of document.

The spell-checker used in librecust project is [Orthos - Greek speller, dictionary and thesaurus](https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/orthos-greek-speller-dictionary-and-thesaurus), an extension developed by Andreas Kasenides. 

We choose to include the combined Greek and English Orthos spell checking package flavor in order to support spell checking for documents supporting either language.

`librecust-<version>.deb` includes the 0.4.0 Orthos version, the latest release at the time of librecust development. However, the developer included update functionality through the LibreOffice Extension Manager so any future updates will be downloaded automatically.
