# Contributing to librecust

First of all, thank you for the intention to contribute to librecust. Open source would be nothing if people like you did not have the initial intention to support projects.

In order for you to enjoy your time contributing to *librecust*, we compiled a list of useful resources that you should initially overview. 

## What should I know to start
* Read the [wiki](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-librecust/wiki)!

  The [wiki](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-librecust/wiki) that accompanies the project development is a useful resource to get started. We suggest at least reading the *Getting Started* and Extension Development chapters in order to get familiar with the principles followed throughout developing librecust (Or even suggest new approaches for the steps described in the wiki).

* Read the great e-book written by [Dr. Andrew Davison](http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/%7Ead/index.html): [Java LibreOffice Programming](http://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/%7Ead/jlop/#contents)

  While the book is written with Java principles in mind, there are chapters that describe universal approaches about LibreOffice extension and customization development. There is no need to read and follow by heart the entire book, however it can be a source of well written documentation in comparison to the scarce one provided by OpenOffice/LibreOffice.

* Take a look at Andrew D. Pitonyak's OpenOffice.org Macros Explained - [OOME Third Edition](http://www.pitonyak.org/OOME_3_0.pdf). 

  This book is a source of inspiration for many parts of librecust code-base. While written for LO Basic, transition to Python implementations is pretty straightforward.


Feedback and issue posting is appreciated, even if you are not familiar with the code-base.

## Some things to have in mind before posting issues:

* Use labels according to your issue (e.g. *enhancement*, *question*...)
* Follow issue templates if possible
* Be polite and always take into account the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2018-librecust/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before posting.

## Submitting code
For better organization of the project, we do not allow straight pull requests to the master branch. You should request through a branch with a descriptive name for the code submitted. In addition to this, ypu should, whenever possible, follow the Pull request templates.

Do not panic, and communicate for any complications during your time with librecust. We seek and are very grateful even for the minor of contributions. 

*HAPPY CODING FOR librecust*
